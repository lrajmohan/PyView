<h2>Intervals</h2>
<p> Intervals are blocks of time during the experiment. The type of interval determines the types of actions that may occur in that time. Types of interval include: </p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Wait</b> During a wait nothing happens. No lever press are rewarded or tone delievered. Ex: ITI</li>
	<li><b>Tone</b> A tone is played throughout the duration of this interval. At the start of this interval the associated valves are also opened.</li>
	<li><b>Reward</b> If a lever is pressed during this interval, one of the active valves will deliver water.</li>
	<li><b>No Go</b> At the end of this interval a reward is given, only if the lever was never pressed during this interval </li>
	</ul>
<p>Each interval consist of the following properties:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Start Time</b> measured in seconds</li>
	<li><b>Duration</b> is how long the interval will take (measured in seconds). A duration may vary by a random scalor factor.</li> 
	<li><b>Action</b> links to an associated action, if there is desire to associate with action. Depending on the action mode, this action may be performed, at the start of the interval,</li>
	at the end of the interval, or anytime during the interval if a lever is pressed.
</ul>
